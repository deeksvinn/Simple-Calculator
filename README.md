# Simple-Calculator
# This program effectively displays the file handling in python.
A simple calculator application which asks the user to select one of two options for input:
1) A text file with equations -- input_file_simple_calculator.txt in this repo can be used as input file for first option selected.
2) Enter two numbers and an operator 
and print out all of the equations into a new text file "simple_calc.txt" with results, which is created in runtime.
